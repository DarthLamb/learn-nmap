# Learn Nmap
Script that utilizes AI to make Nmap more efficient, and writes reports explaining its findings.

## Main Idea
- Takes user input (Host/network, and intrusion level (1-4))
- Scans hosts for open ports/services
- Runs specific scripts based on services found
- Writes a report on its findings, and steps to take next
## Project Philosophy
I built this because I love cybersecurity from a programming perspective. While I'm not the strongest under pressure during live penetration tests, I excel at methodical planning and tool development. My goal is to support security teams by creating flexible, helpful automation that enhances their capabilities.

I hope security professionals will use these scripts, provide feedback on their strengths and weaknesses, and help me iterate toward increasingly useful tools. Thank you for taking the time to explore this projectâ€”I hope it proves valuable in your security work!

## Contributing
Feedback, bug reports, and suggestions are always welcome. This project grows stronger through community input and real-world testing.
