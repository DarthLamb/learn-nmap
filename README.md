# NmapNSE-scripts
Scripts using Nmap NSE to more easily use it.

## Main idea
- Scripts for the 4 steps of attack (Discovery, Vulnerabilites, Exploiting, and Authentication)
- Using custom categories so users can only run these scripts 
- Simple enough to understand, but complex enough to be useful 
- Auto tranfer important info info seperate file (Might make bash script specifically for this)
- Give the users control to be specific 

## Notes
I did this because I love cyber, but from the programming perspective. I am not a fan of doing the actual pen testing, because to be hounest, im not the best underpressure. I like time to plan ahead and come up with ideas. I like to support a team anyway I can, and so if I can makes scripts that are flexiable enough that they help even a little, I'll be happy. 

I hope they can use these scripts this year, tell me the pros and cons, and I can slowly improve them little by little.
